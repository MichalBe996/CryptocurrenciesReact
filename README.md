# CryptocurrenciesReact

Basic React App using Cryptocurrency Messari API, fetching info from this website, taking 10 most popular cryptocurrencies and creating simple table based on gathered
information. Functionality of searchbar is yet to be implemented. For now I have a little problem with finding specific cryptocurrency by name, as most of them have ids.
